A Weather App Built on React JS

This is a simple React App that's built on React using two APIs
1. GeoDB API (From Rapid API)
2. OpenWeatherMap API

The GeoDB API is used to fetch city names for the search 
The OpenWeatherMap API is used to get weather data for the selected city. 

Both the APIs are currently being used on their respective free tiers, meaning that the number of requests per second are limited. 

The app works pretty much like most weather apps, in that it shows the current climate conditions for any city that you select. 
Additionally, the background changes to reflect the current weather for the selected city. 

Features that will be added soon:
1. Forecast for the given city
2. The abitility to `Favourite` cities of your choice so that they'll load whenever you load the app. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
